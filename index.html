    <p><strong>Since 1899 more than 3.6 million people in America have been killed in automobile accidents.</strong> After a peak of 51,093 deaths in 1972, the yearly deaths began to decline despite a growing US population. Common explanations are safety innovations such as seat belts and air bags, but they don't tell the entire story.</p>

    <p><strong>Spikes in gas prices tend to reduce auto deaths.</strong> Americans consistently drove more miles for decades... until 2008's Great Recession. Recessionary periods (shown in gray) related to gas prices seem to reduce auto deaths, even in cases where more and more miles were driven. The Great Recession of 2008 corresponds with an extraordinary drop. It could be due to more people working remotely, using public transit, carpooling, etc. The Obama administration also introduced it's popular Cash-For-Clunkers program, which put <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/cash-for-clunkers-the-final-stats/2000004408/">690,114</a> new and safer cars on the road.</p>

    <p><strong>There are far fewer alcohol related deaths.</strong> Since 1982 the number of alcohol related deaths has dropped from 43,945 to 10,265 in 2015 (-76.6%). Harsher penalties and changing cultural norms are both possible factors in this reduction. Further gains, however, will have to come from the non-alcohol related deaths.
